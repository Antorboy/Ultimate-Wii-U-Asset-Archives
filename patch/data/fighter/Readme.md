# Fighter Folder

- Check inside a character folder to find a Readme explaining what's inside and more.

## Character renaming
To make things easier to read, fighters folders has been renamed to their English name; [Reflet -> Robin]

## Echo Fighter and Newcomer
During the develpment of the mod, some of the clone character were intended to be merged with their original counterpart, for example, Lucina was intended to share the same Character slot as Marth.

It was possible to have two character in the same slot while keeping their moveset different, since Echo Fighter are clones with few changes to make it was easy to merge them in orger to make room for more space in the rooser without deleting the replaced character.
To folow to the earlier example, While Marth was sharing his slot with Lucina, that now free slot was taken by Squirtle.

This mean you can find Character Folder relating to two Fighters since you can find codes for two moveset in one file, but you still can find a character file with asset setapared from his Echo counterpart.
